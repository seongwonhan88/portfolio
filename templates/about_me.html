                <p>I am a web developer living in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. <br>
                    I am passionate about building things on my own and getting my hands dirty. <br>
                    I majored in computer science from University of Southern Queensland, Australia.
                    I've been a web developer since 2018, and I love what I do.

                <p>I started my career as a military officer in 2011 for Republic of Korea Air Force.
                    When my service was done I joined World Vision Korea as a system manager in 2015.<br>
                    After many years of pushing paperwork, I decided to turn my career in 2018.
                    I took a bootcamp in Seoul, and started my first job as a developer at Marshall Goldsmith Coaching.
