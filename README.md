# SW's STAY-AT-HOME project
### *Being a back-end developer I really don't have much to show my skills. So to take advantage of **Stay-At-Home** period I decided to create a portfolio.*
### *The more I try, the more I find myself that I'm not really good at front-end/UI work. BUT! This will show that I tried. I really did.*

## 1. Practice using Django Template
- Three pages of HTML/CSS  
- Use Form to store/validate fields. 
- Practice using Bootstrap for mobile friendly view 

## 2. Practice third-party API call
- Mailgun call to send out email for visitors
- Pulling COVID 19 info from https://docs.corona.lmao-xd.wtf/ and modify the display.

## 3. Build a REST API and calling it from my template page
- Building REST API is more of my taste. 

## 4. Deployment using... Docker? 
- Docker container is used. I have failed and failed to learn Docker/Containerization, BUT I finally got it to work! 
- Learning channel: [Christian Kreuzberger](https://youtu.be/90LCcim-wHQ) (it'll take some time but for Django users it's very comprehensive)

## 5. This is getting much bigger than I expected 
- My original plan was to just build a simple portfolio site for learning CSS and just toss it into AWS Elasticbeanstalk
- Obviously more than that happened as I kept learning and attaching some more.
- Good practice for setting up production environment as well.. 

## 6. Stay-home project continues!  
- Stay tuned for more updates..
